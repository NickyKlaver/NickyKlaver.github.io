<p>When starting with an analysis, inspecting the data is essential. If you do not first inspect the data, then you do not know what you are looking for, of what you are already missing. The point of inspecting data is to comprehend, and to look for anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>When inspecting the data from the C. Elegans plate (which was given to us in an excel file), we can see the following:</p>
<li>
In the RawData column, there are some values that are 0, and values that are blank.
</li>
<li>
The first 2 columns ‘plateRow’ &amp; ‘plateColumn’ are empty of values.
</li>
<li>
The data set is in a tidy format:
<ul>
<li>
Each variable must have its own column.
</li>
<li>
Each observation must have its own row.
</li>
<li>
Each value must have its own cell.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The column ‘incubationVolume’ has a numeric value and a character value, which makes it no really machine readable.
</li>

<h2>Read in excel file in R<a href="portfolio-assignment-1.1-c-elegans-plate.html#read-in-excel-file-in-r" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>After inspection it is time to read in the data frame into an object with the read_excel function in the readxl package. After reading in the package, I always like to check in a grammar of tables or in a reactable that all my data is sorted nicely. You could also use view() but it prefer it this way.</p>

<p>We also would like to aspect the class of the used data. If a data type should be numeric, but because it was imported via an excel file and it transposed it into a character, it would be much harder for computer to do something with this data, because it is not presented as it should. In this example, the comp concentration data should be numeric, but is presented as character. This is a classic example of data importing in R and giving the wrong data type to the columns.</p>

When creating the scatter plot shown above, we see that the X-axis has values that do not comprehend with each other. They are not linear, or exponential, or anything related to each other. This is caused by the datatype character of column compound concentration.</p>

<p>To really further analyse this data, you would have to put each compound out against each RawData sample, so you can see the IC50 and its curve. We will start by 1. selecting and dividing the compounds and adding each compound concentration, with each RawData (offspring) that is set to it, into a new data frame or tibble. After that we 2. will make a scatter plot, and the dots on the plot will represent the amount of offspring at that specific concentration. Then we 3. create a line at the 50% mark of the inhibition (50% less offspring) by calculating the offspring with and without the added substance, and taking half of this. If we do this for all the compounds we can look at the different inhibitory functions of the compounds and from here conclude what the effect the different effects of the compounds is on the offspring and the concentration of this compound. When performing other research, you know that this IC50 can be useful in testing so you know for an (almost) certain amount that when using that concentration that 50% less offspring will be there.</p>
