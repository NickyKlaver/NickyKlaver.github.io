How am I doing now with respect to this goal? - I am learning how to use git and github, and I am thus making my work more reproducible. What would be the next skill to learn? - I wuold need to learn how to analyse single cell sequencing, and also how to manipulate and communicate those results and visualize them as well. Planning: - I have to find a single cell Seq. dataset and I have to inspect if it is something that I can work with. - I have to make the data tidy, then analyse the data with R and with bash. - I have to gather the results, and interpret these results into a graph of chart. - I have to put all this in a Rmarkdown which can be checked, and reproduced, only having to insert the used data set. - I have to work via the workflow protocol, meaning with Git and Github. 2.1 Note the following points: It has to be life sciences or useful for life sciences (no knitting, riding horses etc) It has to be data science / bioinformatics You have to show your plan in your portfolio, together with the result of the first few steps you took in trying to reach this goal.
